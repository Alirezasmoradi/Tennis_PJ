# Tennis Data Analysis Project  
A comprehensive data analysis project exploring tennis match statistics to uncover player performance patterns, match dynamics, and comparative metrics. The project combines data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and insightful visualizations using Python.

## Project Features
This notebook answers multiple analytical questions, including :
+ Total number of unique players
+ Average player height
+ Player with the highest number of match wins
+ Average number of sets per match


+ Countries producing the most winning players (by gender)

+ Average number of aces per match

+ Gender-based comparison of double faults

+ Correlation between player height and ranking

+ Average number of games per set (Men vs. Women)

+ Distribution of left-handed vs. right-handed players by country

+ Most common court surfaces used in matches

+ Average number of breaks of serve per match

## Tools & Libraries
+ Python
+ Pandas
+ NumPy
+ Matplotlib
+ Seaborn
+ Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure
+ match_dataframe — Match-level player and tournament data

+ statistics_dataframe — Match statistics (e.g., aces, double faults)

+ odds_dataframe — Win prediction and match outcome indicators

+ power_dataframe — Set-level match power and duration data

+ points_dataframe — Point-by-point play records
## Objective
This project was developed as part of a Data Science learning path, with the goal of exploring sports analytics through real-world tennis data. It highlights trends in player performance and tournament characteristics using visual storytelling and Python analysis.
